## Lord Of The Objects Project

Week 2 for Skill Distillery Cohort 22 Java bootcamp.

### Overview

Go on an epic quest slaying mythical beings of
lore, get loot, and find the legendary MacGuffin treasure...
in about the time it takes to brew a cup of coffee. You will use your keyboard to attack, defend, and continue on your journey with the ability to call it quits at certain points and go home.

### Technologies Used
* Java
* Eclipse
* Git
* Atom

### Lessons Learned

The ability to create additional classes and using inheritance made writing the player and enemies much easier, in that I did not have to rewrite (copy+paste) four times. However I can see the utility in being able to set the majority of the variables in the parent class and just add what is unique to each of its "children" as I needed them.  

Pair programming makes being lost in the sauce, as my former team leader put it, more bearable and fun. I acted as the driver while my partner, Mark Agbayani, navigated through the maze that was coding our Lord Of The Projects.
When I got stuck, Mark was good at giving me the next place to go and when he got stuck, I was able to write some new direction to try. Usually this just gave us another idea of what not to do.

### The Plan

When I first saw the project I started creating classes for the player, enemies, and another class I was dubbing as Rooms to act as outlines for what I wanted in the program. Editing code out or throwing in new methods as I found ideas on the internet and class. Not having learned inheritance until the next day made much of this work redundant and inefficient. When Mark became my partner we sat down and drew out the rough concept of the classes, threw away the Rooms class to use the enemies methods as the "rooms" they were encountered in. Slowly the program was brought together as the objectives were checked off, the bugs exterminated and the program became more and more.

Big thanks goes to Jeremy Botta as he helped Mark and I figure out why Lord Of The Objects was not acting the way it should.
